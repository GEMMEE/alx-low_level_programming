# 0x02. C- Functions, nested loops

## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the **`Betty style`**
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library(no `printf` or `puts`, etc)
* You are allowed to use your own defined header file
* You are allowed to use `_putchar` and you don't have to push `_putchar.c` file.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.

### More Info
* You do not have to understand the call by reference

## Tasks (_mandatory_)

* [0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c)
prints \_putchar, followed by a new line.
  * The program should return 0

* [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c)
prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  * Prototype: `void print_alphabet(void)`;
  * You can only use \_putchar twice in your code

* [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c)
prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

  * Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
  * You can only use \_putchar twice in your code

* [3-islower.c](./3-islower.c)
 checks for lowercase character.

  * Prototype: int \_islower(int c);
  * Returns 1 if c is lowercase
  * Returns 0 otherwise
