# Alx Low-level Programming 
:computer:

## Description
The following projects cover the c programming language from basic to advanced level. After doing each project, we are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), __without the help of Google__ the learning objective mentioned.

Plagiarism is strictly forbidden for obvious reasons and doing the hard thing is the culture at ALX.
