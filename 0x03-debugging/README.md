# 0x03. C- Debugging

> Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as `gdb` or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

### Resources
+ Watch `Debugging C Programs with GDB` by [NeuralNine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny6y0pPO--4)

+ Watch `Talk to the Duck!` by [Jacob Sorber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxe03H_-TF0)

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

+ What is debugging
+ What are some methods of debugging manually
+ How to read the error messages
